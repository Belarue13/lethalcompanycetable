# LethalCompanyCETable OUTDATED
A cheat engine table for Lethal Company. I will continue to work on this as time goes on (given I still play the game). So far I have a money pointer so you can change your money in game and a health pointe
r.

The Money pointer seems to work even if you are not host, though it seems a little buggy.
The Health pointer should work even when not the host. It does NOT prevent 1-hit kill events.

# How To Run

1. download cheat engine via https://www.cheatengine.org
2. launch Lethal Company
3. open my .ct file
4. click the top left button under file (monitor icon)
5. select lethal company
6. keep saved addresses

After those steps, you should be good to use the cheats.
The cheats will be on the bottom and given names (money, stamina, etc.)

to change your money, double click the current value in my table and change it.
to lock values in place (health) or activate certain cheats, check the active box.
