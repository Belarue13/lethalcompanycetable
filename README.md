# LethalCompanyCETable
A cheat engine table for Lethal Company. I will continue to work on this as time goes on (given I still play the game). So far I have a money pointer so you can change your money in game and a host only Stamina Pointer. 

The Money pointer seems to work even if you are not host, though it seems a little buggy.

The Stamina pointer is not mine, credit to whoever found it. It is host only though. 

Until I find out how to remove a file from this repository, there will be multiple:
the one that has money in the name is just the money table, the pep one has both money and stamina.

# How To Run

1. download cheat engine via https://www.cheatengine.org
2. launch Lethal Company
3. open my .ct file
4. click the top left button under file (monitor icon)
5. select lethal company
6. keep saved addresses

After those steps, you should be good to use the cheats.
The cheats will be on the bottom and given names (money, stamina, etc.)

to change your money, double click the current value in my table and change it.
to lock values in place or activate certain cheats, check the active box.
